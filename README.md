# RetroGNN: Fast Estimation of Synthesizability for Virtual Screening and De Novo Design by Learning from Slow Retrosynthesis Software

Implementation for our [paper](https://pubs.acs.org/action/showCitFormats?doi=10.1021/acs.jcim.1c01476&ref=pdf), J. Chem. Inf. Model., **2022**, in press. [Previous version](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13042) was accepted at NeurIPS ML4Molecules Workshop, 2019.

Currently, the repository includes synthesizability scores of organic molecules from [Molecule.one](https://www.molecule.one/), and [AiZynthFinder](https://github.com/MolecularAI/aizynthfinder), as well as example GNN models (using [chemprop](https://github.com/chemprop/chemprop)) trained on them in the small building block search space, as described in the paper. This project is a part of a larger project of [LambdaZero](https://mila.quebec/en/ai-society/exascale-search-of-molecules/) and this repository is an extraction from it, where original commits are lost. Example code for virtual screening and Boltzmann search will be made available soonï¼Œto be extracted from the internal repository.
